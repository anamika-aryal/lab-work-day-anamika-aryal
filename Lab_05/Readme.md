# Lab 5: Integrating ESP32 Sensor Data with Cloud-Based REST API and Dashboard Visualization

## 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to interface a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor with an ESP32 development board, transmit the collected sensor data to a cloud-hosted REST API deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, store the data in a cloud database, and visualize both real-time and historical sensor readings through a web dashboard.

## 2. Background Theory

### 2.1 ESP32 Microcontroller

The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems. It features:

- Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- Dual-core processor
- Multiple GPIO pins
- Support for HTTP, MQTT, I2C, SPI, UART, and ADC

Its integrated Wi-Fi capability makes it an ideal platform for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

### 2.2 DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

The DHT22 (AM2302) is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that provides:

- High accuracy
- Wide measurement range
- Stable digital output

The sensor communicates with the ESP32 through a single-wire digital communication protocol.

### 2.3 REST API

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a standard architecture for communication between clients and servers over HTTP.

In this experiment:

- ESP32 acts as the client.
- AWS EC2 hosts the REST API.
- Sensor readings are uploaded using **HTTP POST** requests.
- Stored data is retrieved using **HTTP GET** requests.

### 2.4 IoT Data Flow

The complete IoT workflow is shown below.

    dht.begin();

    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        delay(500);
    }

    Serial.println("WiFi Connected");
}

void loop() {

    float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
    float humidity = dht.readHumidity();

    if (!isnan(temperature) && !isnan(humidity)) {

        if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {

            HTTPClient http;

            http.begin(serverUrl);

            http.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

            String payload =
                "{\"temperature\":"
                + String(temperature)
                + ",\"humidity\":"
                + String(humidity)
                + "}";

            http.POST(payload);

            http.end();
        }

        Serial.print("Temperature: ");
        Serial.println(temperature);

        Serial.print("Humidity: ");
        Serial.println(humidity);
